## Project Overview

Welcome to my CS50W project repository! This project is a clone of the Google search page, created using HTML and CSS. It's designed to mimic the look and feel of Google's own search service while allowing users to perform actual searches.

## Features

- **Google Search**: The main page resembles Google's own search page, complete with a search bar and Google's iconic branding. Users can type in their queries and be redirected to Google's search results.

- **Image Search**: A dedicated image search page allows users to search for images specifically. It's styled to look like Google's image search, providing a familiar experience.

- **Advanced Search**: For more refined searching, the advanced search page offers additional parameters to narrow down search results, similar to Google's advanced search options.
