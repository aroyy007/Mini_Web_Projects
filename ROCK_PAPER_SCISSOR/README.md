## Project Description


This project is a simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game implemented using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The game allows the player to compete against the computer in the classic hand game.

## Features:
- User-friendly interface with three selectable options: Rock 🪨, Paper 📄, and Scissors ✂️.
- Real-time updates displaying the player’s and computer’s choices.
- Score tracking system that shows the player's and computer’s score.
- Visual feedback when the player wins, loses, or ties a round.

### How it works:
1. The player selects one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
2. The computer randomly picks its choice.
3. The game determines the winner based on the traditional rules:
   - Rock beats Scissors.
   - Scissors beat Paper.
   - Paper beats Rock.
4. The score is updated, and a message displays whether the player won, lost, or tied the round.
